## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Realistic Step-to-Elevation Ratios
```swift
let stepToElevationRatios: [MountainDifficulty: Double] = [
    .beginner: 15.0,      // Easy trails
    .intermediate: 25.0,  // Moderate trails  
    .advanced: 40.0,      // Difficult trails
    .expert: 60.0,        // Technical climbing
    .extreme: 100.0       // Extreme conditions
]
```

### Camp Elevation Calculation
```swift
let campElevation = camp.altitude - mountain.baseElevationStart
```

### HealthKit Conversion (Verified Correct)
```swift
let meters = flights * 10 * 0.3048  // 10 feet per flight, 0.3048 meters per foot
```
