## Realistic Step Calculation System

### Core Principle: Steps = Climbing Difficulty + Time Investment

Instead of 1:1 step-to-meter mapping, we'll use a **Difficulty-Adjusted Step System** that reflects:
1. **Actual climbing time required**
2. **Physical exertion per meter gained**
3. **Environmental challenges**
4. **Acclimatization requirements**

### Step Calculation Formula

```
Total Steps = (Elevation Gain × Difficulty Multiplier × Time Factor) + Base Steps

Where:
- Elevation Gain = Actual meters to climb
- Difficulty Multiplier = Mountain-specific difficulty rating
- Time Factor = Days required for realistic ascent
- Base Steps = Daily activity baseline
```

### Mountain-Specific Calculations

#### Mount Everest (8,848m)
- **Elevation Gain**: 3,484m (from Base Camp to Summit)
- **Difficulty Multiplier**: 25.0 (extreme difficulty)
- **Time Factor**: 35 days (express climb)
- **Base Steps**: 10,000 steps/day (acclimatization hiking)
- **Total Steps**: (3,484 × 25.0 × 35) + (10,000 × 35) = **3,049,000 + 350,000 = 3,399,000 steps**

#### Mount Kilimanjaro (5,895m)
- **Elevation Gain**: 4,067m (from base to summit)
- **Difficulty Multiplier**: 8.0 (intermediate difficulty)
- **Time Factor**: 7 days
- **Base Steps**: 8,000 steps/day
- **Total Steps**: (4,067 × 8.0 × 7) + (8,000 × 7) = **227,752 + 56,000 = 283,752 steps**

#### Mount Fuji (3,776m)
- **Elevation Gain**: 1,471m (from 5th Station to summit)
- **Difficulty Multiplier**: 3.0 (beginner difficulty)
- **Time Factor**: 1 day
- **Base Steps**: 5,000 steps (approach hike)
- **Total Steps**: (1,471 × 3.0 × 1) + 5,000 = **9,413 steps**

#### El Capitan (914m)
- **Elevation Gain**: 914m (vertical gain)
- **Difficulty Multiplier**: 15.0 (technical climbing)
- **Time Factor**: 4 days
- **Base Steps**: 3,000 steps/day (approach and preparation)
- **Total Steps**: (914 × 15.0 × 4) + (3,000 × 4) = **54,840 + 12,000 = 66,840 steps**

#### Mount Rainier (4,392m)
- **Elevation Gain**: 2,892m (from Paradise to summit)
- **Difficulty Multiplier**: 12.0 (advanced difficulty)
- **Time Factor**: 3 days
- **Base Steps**: 7,000 steps/day
- **Total Steps**: (2,892 × 12.0 × 3) + (7,000 × 3) = **104,112 + 21,000 = 125,112 steps**

## Realistic Climbing Mechanics

### 1. Acclimatization System

#### Altitude Sickness Risk
- **Risk Zones**: 
  - 2,500-3,500m: Mild risk
  - 3,500-5,500m: Moderate risk
  - 5,500-7,500m: High risk
  - 7,500m+: Extreme risk (Death Zone)

#### Acclimatization Requirements
- **Daily Elevation Gain Limit**: 300-500m per day
- **Rest Days**: Required every 3-4 days above 3,500m
- **Descent Penalties**: Rapid ascent increases altitude sickness risk
- **Recovery Time**: 2-3 days for full recovery from altitude sickness

### 2. Weather and Environmental Factors

#### Weather Impact on Progress
- **Clear Weather**: 100% progress rate
- **Cloudy**: 90% progress rate
- **Rain/Storm**: 50% progress rate (rest day required)
- **Blizzard**: 0% progress rate (forced rest)

#### Seasonal Considerations
- **Everest**: Climbing season April-May, September-October
- **Kilimanjaro**: Best conditions January-March, June-October
- **Fuji**: Official season July-August
- **Rainier**: May-September
- **El Capitan**: Year-round (weather dependent)

### 3. Equipment and Safety Systems
