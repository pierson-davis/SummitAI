## 🔍 Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Navigation State Conflicts ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Multiple navigation managers and conflicting state updates causing UI bouncing
**Solution**: 
- Centralized navigation management through `NavigationManager`
- Implemented proper sheet presentation hierarchy
- Added conflict prevention with delayed sheet presentation
- Created unified `MountainExperiencesHomeView` as main entry point

### 2. Sheet Presentation Issues ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Overlapping sheet presentations and improper dismissal
**Solution**:
- Removed local filter and drawer overlays from `HomeDiscoverView`
- Centralized all sheet presentations in `MainTabView`
- Added proper sheet dismissal handling
- Implemented sheet conflict prevention

### 3. State Management Problems ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Multiple `@StateObject` instances causing conflicts
**Solution**:
- Ensured proper `@EnvironmentObject` usage for shared managers
- Added `loadSampleData()` method to prevent initialization issues
- Implemented proper state synchronization between managers

### 4. Animation Conflicts ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Multiple animations running simultaneously
**Solution**:
- Disabled location cycling animations temporarily
- Disabled atmospheric effects to prevent conflicts
- Added proper animation coordination

### 5. Data Flow Issues ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Inconsistent data updates between managers
**Solution**:
- Enhanced `MountainExperiencesDataManager` with proper data loading
- Added debounced state updates to prevent rapid changes
- Implemented proper data persistence

## 🛠️ Technical Fixes Implemented

### NavigationManager Enhancements
```swift
func presentSheet(_ sheet: PresentedSheet) {
    // Prevent sheet conflicts by dismissing any existing sheets first
    if presentedSheet != nil {
        dismissSheet()
    }
    
    // Add a small delay to prevent animation conflicts
    DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.1) {
        self.presentedSheet = sheet
        self.addToNavigationHistory(.sheetPresented(sheet))
    }
}
```

### ContentView Restructuring
```swift
struct MainTabView: View {
    // Centralized sheet presentation
    .sheet(item: $navigationManager.presentedSheet) { sheet in
        sheetView(for: sheet)
    }
    
    @ViewBuilder
    private func sheetView(for sheet: NavigationManager.PresentedSheet) -> some View {
        // Unified sheet handling for all Mountain Experiences views
    }
}
```

### HomeDiscoverView Stabilization
```swift
struct HomeDiscoverView: View {
    // Removed conflicting local state
    // Centralized navigation through NavigationManager
    // Disabled problematic animations
    
    .onChange(of: navigationManager.presentedSheet) { sheet in
        // Handle sheet state changes to prevent conflicts
        // Sheets are now managed by NavigationManager
    }
}
```

### MountainExperiencesDataManager Improvements
```swift
func loadSampleData() {
    // Ensure sample data is loaded
    if availableTrips.isEmpty {
        loadAvailableTrips()
    }
    if availableLocations.isEmpty {
        loadAvailableLocations()
    }
}
```
