## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Hybrid Background System:**
```swift
AsyncImage(url: URL(string: featuredLocation.coverImageURL)) { image in
    image
        .resizable()
        .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fill)
        .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, maxHeight: .infinity)
        .clipped()
} placeholder: {
    // Beautiful mountain-themed gradient fallback
    LinearGradient(
        gradient: Gradient(colors: [
            Color(red: 0.1, green: 0.2, blue: 0.4), // Dark blue
            Color(red: 0.2, green: 0.3, blue: 0.5), // Medium blue
            Color(red: 0.3, green: 0.4, blue: 0.6), // Lighter blue
            Color(red: 0.4, green: 0.5, blue: 0.7)  // Light blue
        ]),
        startPoint: .topLeading,
        endPoint: .bottomTrailing
    )
    .ignoresSafeArea()
}
```

### **Automatic Location Cycling:**
- **Timer**: Changes background every 8 seconds
- **Animation**: Smooth 1.5-second transitions
- **Locations**: Cycles through all 5 mountain locations
- **Effect**: Users see different inspiring mountain backgrounds

### **Robust Error Handling:**
- **Network Issues**: Falls back to beautiful gradient
- **Image Loading**: Graceful placeholder while loading
- **Invalid URLs**: Automatic fallback to gradient background
- **Performance**: Optimized image loading with proper sizing

## 🎨 **Visual Experience**

### **What Users Will See:**

1. **Dynamic Backgrounds**: Real mountain photos that change every 8 seconds
2. **Smooth Transitions**: Beautiful animations between different mountains
3. **Professional Quality**: High-resolution, properly cropped mountain photography
